# 1D-CNN-Anomaly-Detection-via-CASPER

This is the repo for the paper titled as: 

**CASPER: Context-Aware IoT Anomaly Detection System for Industrial Robotic Arms**

`Figures` folder contains **coding-related figures** of the paper.

`models` folder contains **LSTM and CNN** models.

`results` folder contains loss values for **LSTM and CNN**.

`CASPER.ipynb` is the main **Jupyter Notebook** file where the work is presented.

**Node-RED package** that we developed that enables BLE communication: [node-red-contrib-ble-sense](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ble-sense)

In that repository see `niclaBLEIMUStruct` folder the utilized **Arduino sketch**.
