# CASPER: Context-Aware IoT Anomaly Detection System for Industrial Robotic Arms

Welcome to the repository for the paper titled **CASPER**. This system is designed for anomaly detection in industrial robotic arms using IoT technology.

## Main Jupyter Notebook
The main analysis and presentation of work can be found in the Jupyter notebook:
- [`casper.ipynb`](/notebooks/casper.ipynb)

## Node-RED BLE Communication Package
We have also developed a Node-RED package to facilitate BLE communication, which you can find here:
- [node-red-contrib-ble-sense](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-ble-sense)

## Arduino Sketch for BLE IMU Data
Check out the `niclaBLEIMUStruct` folder for the Arduino sketch used in our research.

> **Note:** This repository is under active development as the associated paper is undergoing major revision. Stay tuned for updates.

For more details, please refer to the first cell of the casper.ipynb notebook.
